# birthday-wisher

This python program will send birth wishes to your friends and family. You will have to modify, it is just a template.

It works if you use gmail. For any other mail you will have to modify line #24

If you want the program to work everyday and check if someone has birthday, you can host it for example on pythonanywhere.com

Remember to add people to 'birthdays.csv' the same way as given example.
